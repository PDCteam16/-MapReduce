In this project, we detail how data is transformed as it executes in the MapReduce framework, how to design and implement the Mapper, Reducer, and Driver classes; and execute the MapReduce program of displaying WordCount.
There are four fundamental transformations. Data is:
   1. Transformed from the input files and fed into the mappers
   2. Transformed by the mappers
   3.Sorted, merged, and presented to the reducer
   4. Transform by reducers and written to output files
